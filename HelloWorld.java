/*Reflection
Using Github is really confusing. First, I couldn't quite understand
how to create the repository. Created two folders and put my work in
the wrong folder. When I checked the repository it wasn't showing.
Then I was able to see it in the correct folder. Was able to push my
commits to the remote repository on Github, I think that was the easiest.
Being able to see it on the website went well, which I think I did everything
how it is supposed to be. But yes, Github is not very user friendly.
Did take some time to get the things done.*/
